  <p>The Apache HTTP Server, colloquially called Apache (/əˈpætʃi/ ə-PATCH-ee), is free and open-source cross-platform web server software, released under the terms of Apache License 2.0. Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation.</p>
  <p>The vast majority of Apache HTTP Server instances run on a Linux distribution,[5] but current versions also run on Windows and OS/2,[6] and a wide variety of Unix-like systems. Past versions also ran on OpenVMS,[7] NetWare and other operating systems.[8]</p>
  <p>Originally based on the NCSA HTTPd server, development of Apache began in early 1995 after work on the NCSA code stalled. Apache played a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web,[9] quickly overtaking NCSA HTTPd as the dominant HTTP server, and has remained most popular since April 1996. In 2009, it became the first web server software to serve more than 100 million websites.[10] As of August 2018, it was estimated to serve 39% of all active websites and 35% of the top million websites.[11] </p>
