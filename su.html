  <p>Semantic UI is based on the belief that the conceptual building block of websites is not individual HTML tags, but individual interface elements. Interface elements are components like buttons, dropdowns, and modals, elements that structure and contextualize web content. Arranged together in a page they create visual flow which we think of as a website.</p>
  <p>Most community debate around componentizing the web seems to be centered around what is the best exchange format for creating web components. This can be thought of as similar to a room full of writers arguing about "What is the best language to compose a novel?". We all know that any great novel, although written in a language that was convenient or familiar for the author, will eventually be translated to many other languages, in a way that still preserves its most important quality, its meaning.</p>
  <p>Semantic views the debate on format as a paralyzing impasse to the more critical development of consensus around standards for the meaning and interrelation of user interface elements.</p>
